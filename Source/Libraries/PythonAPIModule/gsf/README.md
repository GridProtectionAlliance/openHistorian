# Python Implementation of the Grid Solutions Framework

The [Grid Solutions Framework](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/technology.asp#GSF) (GSF) is an extensive collection of open source collection used by electric power utilities and various open source projects. GSF contains a large variety of code with a focus on tools and protocol parsers that are useful for the electric power industry.

This is a limited Python implementation of GSF needed to support the [SNAPdb Engine](../snapDB) and the [openHistorian Python API](../).
