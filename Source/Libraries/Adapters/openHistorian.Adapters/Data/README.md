### SNR Database Scripts
These are scripts that can be used to enable the signal to noise (SNR), voltage unbalance and current unbalance reports in openHistorian.

Enabling action adapter (included) from within openHistorian UI manager to enable report processing is required.

Edit `...\wwwroot\Layout.cshtml` to uncomment web-based report links in openHistorian web manager to access reports.
