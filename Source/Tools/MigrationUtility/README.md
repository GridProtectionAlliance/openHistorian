The openHistorian Archive Upgrade tool, automatically included with an openHistorian installation, is used to convert version 1.0 openHistorian files into the new 2.0 file format. When upgrading to the openHistorian v2.0 from older time-series archives, e.g., the 1.0 openHistorian that is included with the openPDC, this tool can be used to migrate the old data to the newer more higher performance format.
