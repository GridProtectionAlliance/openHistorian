The openHistorian Archive Comparison tool, automatically included with an openHistorian installation, is used to compare two separate openHistorian archives and produce a report of differences. When two or more openHistorian instances are configured to archive the same data, e.g., in a highly available environment, this tool can be used to produce a report on archive consistency.
