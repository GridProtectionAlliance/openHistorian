# Three Phase Power Calculations Template
#
# File format is tab-delimited with the following columns:
#     Tag Name->Inputs->Equation->Type->Description
#
# Tag Name column defines identifier that becomes part of the point tag name of the calculation result
# Inputs column defines the particular inputs for the specified calculation type
# Equation column defines the equation of the calculation, if applicable to the calculation type
# Type column defines calculation type and is one of: CalculatePower, SumPhase or DynamicCalculator
# Description column defines a textual explanation of the calculation used to describe calculation purpose
#
# CalculatePower type creates power calculations for paired voltage/current phasors where
# Inputs column is one of: +, A, B or C
#
# SumPhase type creates a 3-phase power summation when A, B and C power calculations are available where
# Inputs column is one of: MW, MVAR or MVA
#     
# DynamicCalculator type creates an equation-based calculation using one or more selected inputs separated by semi-colon where
# Inputs column variables are as follows - note that phasor based inputs will create one calculation per phasor type (V or I):
#     VNOM: Nominal Voltage = derived from per voltage phasor screen input in kV
#      VAM: Voltage A-Phase Magnitude also VBM, VCM, VNM for B, C & N phases and VPOSM, VNEGM, VZM for +, -, 0 sequence
#      VAA: Voltage A-Phase Angle     also VBA, VCA, VNA            ^            VPOSA, VNEGA, VZA
#      IAM: Current A-Phase Magnitude also IBM, ICM, INM         Neutral         IPOSM, INEGM, IZM
#      IAA: Current A-Phase Angle     also IBA, ICA, INA                         IPOSA, INEGA, IZA
#     FREQ: Frequency
#     FNOM: Constant nominal frequency per defined global system configuration, defaults to 60
#     FAVG: Current average frequency - must be pre-calculated with signal reference of "SYSTEM!FREQ-AVG-FQ"
#    FLAGS: Status Flags, e.g., IEEE C37.118 STAT word
